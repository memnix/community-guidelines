# We use Github Flow 
___

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase ([Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

# Reporting a bug
___


We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. 

After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. 

- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or create a gist, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.

- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 

- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action,** describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

- **Which version are you using?** 

- **What's the name and version of the OS you're using?**

# Suggesting Enhancements
___

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Memnix, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions .

When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in the template, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

**Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion**

- **Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in.**

- **Perform a research** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?**

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.

- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.

- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.

- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.

# Your First Code Contribution
___

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- Beginner issues
   - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues
  - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

# Styleguides
___

**Git Commit Messages**

- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

- When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title

- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:

  - :art: when improving the format/structure of the code

  - :racehorse:  when improving performance 

  - :memo: when writing docs

  - :bug: when fixing a bug

  - :fire: when removing code or files

  - :white_check_mark: when adding tests

  - :lock: when dealing with security

  - :arrow_up: when upgrading dependencies
